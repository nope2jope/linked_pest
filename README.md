# linked_pest
robot applies for the job, hm

given an active linkedin profile (w/ resume, contact info, etc), this application navigates to linked in, signs in, and goes through the process of applying to jobs in the user's provided field and location of interest 

the application at this point hinges on the now-defunct 'easy apply' filter, but is still representative of the process and functional. app would need additional conditionals to navigate through the process as linkedin has it now
